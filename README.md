# graphics-taster
Presentation on graphics originally from June 2016, updated July 2023 to make it more reproducible and use SPC styling for the slides.

graphics-communicating.qmd is a Quarto document that builds into graphics-communicating.html, which is a revealjs HTML presentation.

Run `build.R` to build. Not fully reproducible without access to the `spcstyle` R package, but not difficult to work around that (ie change the few snippets of code that use functions from it.)
